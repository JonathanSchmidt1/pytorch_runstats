``torch_runstats`` implements memory-efficient online reductions on tensors. 

 .. note::
   The implementations currently heavily use in-place operations for peformance and memory efficiency. This probably doesn't play nice with the autograd engine â€” this is currently likely the wrong library for accumulating running statistics you want to backward through. (See `TorchMetrics <https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for a possible alternative.)

Currently supported :class:`Reduction` s are:

 .. autoclass:: torch_runstats.Reduction
   :members:

Support for bincounting integers and combined one-pass mean/standard deviation are planned.

The core of the library is the :class:`RunningStats` class:

 .. autoclass:: torch_runstats.RunningStats
   :members:
